# Changelog

All notable release changes are recorded here. TeX Core follows Semantic
Versioning for source packages and public API behavior; the C binary ABI is
not promised to remain compatible between releases.

## Unreleased

- Land the C core walking skeleton: `tex_core_document_compile` over the
  document/math-inline/math-display input forms, an immutable render tree
  (hbox/glyph/kern) with embedded KaTeX-derived Computer Modern metrics,
  byte-deterministic canonical dumps in integer scaled points, structured
  fail-fast errors with source ranges, the `tex-core` CLI, and the full
  CMake/CTest graph (correctness, conformance, benchmark, sanitizer presets,
  libFuzzer harness).
- Bootstrap the repository: adopt the setup plan
  (`docs/specs/2026-07-20-repo-setup.md`), import the repository setup
  template contract, and establish repository identity and hygiene.
